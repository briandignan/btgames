Bittorrent Games
----------------

Create trackers, peers, and run your own bittorrent client on an Amazon EC2 instance.

You'll need your AWS credentials in environmental variables
`AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY` and `AMAZON_SECRET_KEY`
to run the fabric scripts.

Remember to turn off your instances when you're done!
